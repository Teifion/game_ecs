Angles are stored internally everywhere as radians. They should be entered and printed in degrees, transformation happens as soon as they are read in and as they are printed.

Facings are a pair of angles fxy, and fyz. fxy refers to left-right on a top-down 2D plane. An angle of 0 refers to directly upwards, 90 to the right.

fyz refers to an up-down in 3D. 0 refers to being level, 90 would mean you aim directly down down (groundward) and 270 would mean it points upwards.
